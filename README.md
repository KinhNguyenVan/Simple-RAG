This project implements a Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide intelligent and contextual answers to user queries based on policy-related content from a website. The pipeline includes web crawling, data preprocessing, embedding generation using BGE-M3, and cosine similarity for document retrieval. Retrieved context is used to prompt a language model (LLM) to generate accurate and relevant responses. Ideal for navigating and querying policy documents efficiently.
